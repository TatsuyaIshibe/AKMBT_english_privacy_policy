1. We do not collect any data you enter inside your custom quick keys. It is stored locally on your device.<br>
2. We do not record your login information, IDs, addresses, e-mails etc. that you store in the app.<br>
3. We need Full Access to load your data from application to quick keys outside the app. It's the only way in iOS design to use quick keys for custom information.<br>
